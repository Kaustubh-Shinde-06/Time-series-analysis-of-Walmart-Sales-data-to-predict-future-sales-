The project aimed at creating a timeseries model for analyzing past Walmart sales data from varied locations and varied categories to predict the future sales of items.The dataset used has been taken from 

This post contains two main parts:
the data preprocessing, which aims at cleaning the data and selecting the most useful features for the models as well as generating new features. The modelling with 3 different algorithms: Random Forests, Gradient Boost Regression, Decision Trees and Linear Regression models.

This entire Project has been done in Databricks using PySpark.
