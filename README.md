# Big Data Science : Timeseries analysis of Walmart Sales data to predict future sales
The project aimed at creating a timeseries model for analyzing past Walmart sales data from varied locations and varied categories to predict the future sales of items.The dataset used has been taken from Kaggle and consists of sales data from January 2011 to June 2016

The project contains two parts:
The data preprocessing, which aims at cleaning the data and selecting the most useful features for the models as well as generating new features. The modelling is done with two approaches, one using all the features and second using feature importance. Gradient boosting and Random Forest were the Machine Learning algorithms used while Moving Average and Holts Winters are the statistical models used. 

This entire Project has been done in Databricks using PySpark.
